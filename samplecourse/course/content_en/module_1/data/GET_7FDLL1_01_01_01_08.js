				"text":"The intake stroke is the first stroke of the four-cycle diesel engine. During this stroke, the piston is traveling in a downward motion inside the cylinder. Intake valves located in the combustion chamber are open, allowing air to enter into the chamber. This provides oxygen-laden filtered air to the combustion chamber. The intake stroke provides oxygen, one of the three items needed for combustion."
