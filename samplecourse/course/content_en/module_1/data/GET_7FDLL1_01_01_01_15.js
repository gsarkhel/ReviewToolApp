				"text":"You have reached the end of this module! <br> In this module, you learned to: <li>Describe how a combustion engine operates. </li><li>An internal combustion engine utilizes a chemical reaction between fuel, oxygen and heat. This chemical reaction is used to produce captive, controlled, synchronized explosions, which provide the energy to rotate the primary shaft commonly called a crankshaft. </li><li>List the differences between a gasoline engine and a diesel engine. </li><li>A gasoline engine draws in a mixture of air and fuel into the combustion chamber, whereas a diesel engine initially charges the combustion chamber with just air. </li><li>In a gasoline engine an electronic ignition source is used for ignition, whereas no electrical ignition source is used to ignite the fuel in a diesel engine. </li><li>A diesel engine has a much higher compression ratio than a gasoline engine, which provides the high temperature to ignite the fuel. </li><li>Diesel engines use direct fuel injection while the gasoline engines generally use carburetion or port fuel injection. </li><li>Describe the four strokes of a diesel engine. </li><li>In the intake stroke, the piston travels in a downward motion in the cylinder, allowing air to enter into the chamber. </li><li>In the compression stroke, the piston travels in an upward motion in the cylinder, compressing the air that was drawn into the cylinder during the previous stroke. </li><li>In the combustion stroke, the piston is being forced in a downward motion in the cylinder by the rapid expansion of gases created by the ignited fuel. </li><li>In the exhaust stroke, the piston travels in an upward motion in the cylinder, pushing the exhaust gases out of the combustion chamber. </li>"
