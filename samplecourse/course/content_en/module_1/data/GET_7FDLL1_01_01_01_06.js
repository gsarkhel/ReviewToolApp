				"text":"Diesel engines use direct fuel injection, where the fuel is injected under high pressure directly into the combustion chamber when the air temperature is high enough to instantaneously ignite the fuel. Gasoline engines generally use carburetion or port fuel injection. Port fuel injection is where the fuel is injected in the intake air manifold just prior to the fuel entering the combustion chamber through the intake valve located outside the cylinder. Carburetion is where air and fuel are mixed long before they enter the combustion chamber."
