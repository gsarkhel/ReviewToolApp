				"text":"The exhaust stroke is the fourth and final stroke of the four-cycle diesel engine. During this stroke, the piston has changed directions, and again is traveling in an upward motion in the cylinder. The exhaust valves located in the combustion chamber are now open, allowing the piston to push the exhaust gases out of the combustion chamber and into the exhaust manifold. This completes the four strokes of the diesel engine. The crankshaft has rotated two complete turns to complete this cycle."
