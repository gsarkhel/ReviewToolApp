				"text":"The combustion stroke is the third stroke of the four-cycle diesel engine. During this stroke, the piston is being forced in a downward motion in the cylinder by the rapid expansion of gases created by the ignited fuel. This energy is used to power the engine. This is the only stroke that creates mechanical energy. The energy produced from the chemical reaction of the oxygen, heat and fuel is transformed into mechanical energy to rotate the crankshaft."
