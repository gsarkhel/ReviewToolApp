				"text":"The compression stroke is the second stroke of the four-cycle diesel engine. During this stroke, the piston has changed direction to initiate a new stroke, and is traveling in an upward motion in the cylinder. The intake and exhaust valves, located at the top of the combustion chamber, are closed, sealing off the combustion chamber. The piston is compressing the air that was drawn into the cylinder during the previous stroke, the intake stroke. As the air is compressed, the temperature increases rapidly to typically 700 to 1100 degrees Fahrenheit (approximately 370 to 590 degrees Celsius). This produces the second item needed for combustion, heat. At the end of the compression stroke, diesel fuel is injected into the combustion chamber at a very high pressure. Fuel, the third and last item, is now present for combustion. The fuel ignites spontaneously when the fuel mist comes into contact with the very hot air. This starts the third stroke of the cycle: combustion stroke. The crankshaft has now rotated one full turn."
