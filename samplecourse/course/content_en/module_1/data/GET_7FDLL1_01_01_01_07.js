				"text":"As with most automobile gasoline engines, our diesel engines are four-stroke-per-cycle engines, often referred to as simply four-stroke or four-cycle engines. Regardless of the naming convention used, one complete cycle of a four-stroke diesel engine includes four strokes of a piston inside a single cylinder: intake, compression, combustion, and exhaust. During the four strokes, there are three items needed for combustion: oxygen, heat, and fuel."
