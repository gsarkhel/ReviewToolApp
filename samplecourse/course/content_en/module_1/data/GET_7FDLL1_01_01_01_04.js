				"text":"Obviously, there is a difference between the types of fuel used for the gasoline and diesel engines. But another important difference is how ignition of the air-fuel mixture is initiated. The combustion chamber of a gasoline engine receives a mixture of gas and air and compresses it. The mixture is then ignited by means of an electronic ignition source, commonly called a spark plug. Like the gas engine, the combustion chamber of a diesel engine receives and compresses air but initially it is not mixed with fuel. Typically, the compression ratio of a diesel engine is higher than that of a gas engine. Due to this high compression ratio, the air reaches a temperature high enough to spontaneously ignite the fuel that is injected directly into the combustion chamber. No electronic ignition source is used to ignite the fuel."
