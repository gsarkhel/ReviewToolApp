				"text":"Normally, a gasoline engine would have a compression ratio in a range of 8:1 to 12:1, while a diesel engine would normally compress at a ratio from 14:1 to 25:1. If the ratio is 8:1, you can think of this as taking a column of air that is 8 inches high and 1 inch wide, and compressing that column down to a 1 inch high and 1 inch wide column. The higher compression ratio of the diesel engine leads to higher fuel efficiency. The higher compression ratio also raises the temperature of the compressed air."
