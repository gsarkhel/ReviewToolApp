				"text":"The cylinders are numbered from the free end to the alternator or generator end of the engine. The No.1 right and No.1 left cylinders are nearest the turbocharger on all our diesel engines. The right side or left side of the engine is determined when viewing the engine while facing the generator or alternator end of the engine. The right side of the engine is on the left side of the locomotive. During engine operation, the crankshaft rotates counterclockwise when viewed from the alternator end and clockwise when viewed from the free end."
