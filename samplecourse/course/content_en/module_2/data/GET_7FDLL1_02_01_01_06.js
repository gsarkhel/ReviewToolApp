				"text":"The specifications, dimensions and weights of the 7FDL 12-cylinder and 16-cylinder diesel engines are shown in the table. The 12- and 16- cylinder engines are similar on many counts but differ with regard to number of cylinders and their firing order, and also their length and weight. The 7FDL diesel engine has undergone numerous improvements in its 50-plus years of locomotive history. Recently, the changes made to the 7FDL diesel engine have been driven by evolving exhaust emission regulatory standards that govern the locomotive freight hauling industry."
