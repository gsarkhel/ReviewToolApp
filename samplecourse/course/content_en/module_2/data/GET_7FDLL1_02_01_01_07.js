				"text":"To reduce the emissions from locomotives, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) first issued a set of standards in 1973, referred to as the Tier 0 Standards. <li>The primary focus of the EPA regulations is the reduction of nitrogen oxides or NOx. Also measured and regulated are hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, particulate matter, and smoke. </li><li>These pollutants are measured in weight (grams) of pollutants emitted to produce 1 horsepower for 1 hour. The table displays the EPA Tier 0 limits for these pollutants. </li>Although the Tier 0 standards were issued in 1973, they did not become effective until 2000, which allowed manufacturers time for the design and development of new engines to meet the standards."
