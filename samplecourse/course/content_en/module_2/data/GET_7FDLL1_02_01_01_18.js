				"text":"You have reached the end of this module! <br>In this module, you learned to: <li>State the information represented by the 7FDL engine classification. </li><li>The letter-and-numeral code combination used to classify the 7FDL engine is based on the following: </li><li>‘7’ indicates our category of mechanical devices. </li><li>‘F’ represents the 9\" engine cylinder bore and 10.5\" piston stroke. </li><li>‘D’ stands for diesel. </li><li>‘L’ indicates that the engine is designed for a locomotive application. </li><li>Describe the terms associated with the 7FDL diesel engine orientation and cylinder locations. </li><li>The free end of the engine faces the radiator cab. It is the end where the turbocharger and intercoolers are mounted. </li><li>The alternator end of the engine is the end where the generator or alternator is mounted. This end of the engine is oriented towards the operator's cab. </li><li>The cylinders are numbered from the free end to the alternator end of the engine. </li><li>The right side or left side of the engine is determined when viewing the engine while facing the generator or alternator end of the engine. The right side of the engine is on the left side of the locomotive. </li><li>During engine operation, the crankshaft rotates clockwise when viewed from the free end and counterclockwise when viewed from the alternator end. </li><li>Recognize the differences in engine specifications for the 7FDL 12-cylinder and 16-cylinder engines. </li><li>The 7FDL 12-cylinder and 16-cylinder engines differ with respect to engine specifications, such as number of cylinders, firing order, and weight. </li><li>Explain how 7FDL engines have evolved to meet regulatory requirements. </li><li>The primary focus of the EPA regulation is the reduction of nitrogen oxides or NOx. Also measured and regulated are hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, particulate matter, and smoke. </li><li>To meet the Tier 0 emission standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), modified 7FDL diesel engines were put into production on January 1<sup>st</sup>, 2001. Engines manufactured between January 1<sup>st</sup>, 2001 and December 31<sup>st</sup>, 2001 were Tier 0 compliant. </li><li>7FDL diesel engines were put into production on January 1<sup>st</sup>, 2002 through 2004 to comply with the EPA Tier 1 regulations. Going from Tier 0 to Tier 1 represents a 22% reduction in NOx and a 25% reduction in particulate matter. </li><li>In 2008, the emission standards were modified and the revised Tier 0 and Tier 1 were designated as Tier 0+ and Tier 1+. These revised guidelines are applicable to 7FDL engines that were originally produced between 1993 and 2004, but are remanufactured as of January 1<sup>st</sup>, 2010. </li><li>There are currently two different versions of Part 1033-compliant 7FDL diesel engines - the Tier 0+ and the Tier 1+ compliant engines. Differences between the two versions of diesel engines are that Tier 0+ versions maintain the Tier 0 camshaft assemblies and turbochargers. </li><li>There are some Emission Critical Components in the engine that are critical to ensuring compliance with EPA standards. Customers must follow our guidelines for maintenance, repair, and replacement of these components to ensure EPA compliance. Validity of our warranties is also dependent on following these guidelines."
