				"text":"Beginning in January of 2002, all 7FDL diesel engines placed into production through 2004 complied with the EPA Tier 1 regulations. Going from Tier 0 to Tier 1 represented a 22% reduction in NOx and a 25% reduction in particulate matter. The table displays the EPA Tier 1 limits for these pollutants. In order to meet the Tier 2 standards that became effective in 2005, Engineering introduced the Evolution Series of locomotives in North America, replacing the Dash 9 and AC4400 locomotives, both of which used the 7FDL engine."
