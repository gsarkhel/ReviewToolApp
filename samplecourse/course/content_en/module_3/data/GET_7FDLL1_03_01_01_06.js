				"text":"The engine crankshaft, which runs through the center of the mainframe, converts the linear motion of the pistons into radial motion to drive the alternator. For the 12- and 16-cylinder 7FDL diesel engines, there are 7 and 9 main bearing journals, respectively, to anchor the crankshaft to the mainframe. The crankshaft and the bearing journal surfaces are nitride hardened to provide longer component life. The crankshaft main bearings are designed to minimize the friction at the points where the crankshaft is anchored to the mainframe. They also provide a base to control the oil film on which the crankshaft rides."
