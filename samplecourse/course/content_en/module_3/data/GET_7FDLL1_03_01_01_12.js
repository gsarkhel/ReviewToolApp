				"text":"The piston is a critical component in the diesel engine. It compresses air for combustion and transfers the energy produced from combustion to the crankshaft via the connecting rod. The piston is a two piece assembly, consisting of the piston crown and the piston skirt, that is housed within the cylinder assembly. The top or crown of the piston is steel for high strength and resistance. The bottom or skirt of the piston is aluminum for light weight. It houses the piston pin for the connection between the piston and the connecting rod."
