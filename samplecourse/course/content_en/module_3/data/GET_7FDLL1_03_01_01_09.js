				"text":"The rubber-bonded drive coupling provides the interface between the crankshaft and the auxiliary drive gear. The auxiliary drive gear is bolted to the outside ring of the rubber-bonded drive coupling, and drives an idler gear. The idler gear, in turn, drives the water and lubricating oil pumps. In the event that the gear driven oil or water pumps seize or lock up, the rubber bond drive will shear, thus disconnecting the auxiliary drive gear from the crankshaft. This feature is designed to provide crankshaft protection."
