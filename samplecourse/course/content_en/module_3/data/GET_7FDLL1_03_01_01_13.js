				"text":"The purpose of the cylinder assembly is to contain and control the expansion of gases from combustion. The unitized cylinder is made up of three major components: the cylinder jacket, the cylinder liner, and the cylinder head. The cylinder jacket is the outside casting that houses all the other cylinder components. The cylinder liner is a heavy-walled tube that is hardened or chrome plated for extended wear. It is one of the components that forms the combustion chamber. The cylinder liner is assembled inside the cylinder jacket. The cylinder head is welded to the top of the cylinder liner to form the top of the combustion chamber. The intake and exhaust valve guides are assembled to the cylinder head. The valve seats are provided through welding and angle grinding in the cylinder head intake and exhaust ports."
