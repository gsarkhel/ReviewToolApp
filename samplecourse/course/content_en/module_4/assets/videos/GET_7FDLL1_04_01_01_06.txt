00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,733
The purpose of the cooling water system is to maintain the operating temperature of the engine under all throttle calls and load conditions.

2
00:00:08,733 --> 00:00:13,367
Water flows from the water pump into the front end cover of the engine.

3
00:00:13,367 --> 00:00:21,500
Passing through the front end cover, the water then enters the inlet water headers where it is supplied to each of the cylinders.

4
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:33,267
Within each cylinder, water flows through an opening in the cylinder jacket wall and is forced from the lower band of the cylinder liner through drilled passageways to the upper band of the cylinder liner.

5
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:39,133
Cooling water from the top of the cylinder liner then flows to cavities in the cylinder’s head.

6
00:00:39,133 --> 00:00:58,800
After cooling the head, the water passes through an outlet opening in the top of the head and a core passage in the top portion of the cylinder jacket to the water discharge header.
