00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,833
The purpose of the fuel oil system is to provide fuel to the cylinders for combustion and to provide cooling for the high-pressure fuel equipment.

2
00:00:08,833 --> 00:00:15,833
Fuel oil is supplied through parallel low-pressure fuel lines to the inlets of each high-pressure fuel pump.

3
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:22,375
The pumps, driven by the camshafts, pressurize the fuel to over 18,000 psi.

4
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:34,000
A solenoid, located on each high-pressure pump, is electronically controlled to open and close based on control signals from the Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI) computer.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
When the solenoid is open, pressurized fuel oil is fed to the fuel injector through the high-pressure fuel line.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:50,417
At a preset pressure, the fuel is sprayed into the combustion chamber where it combines with compressed air and ignites, causing combustion to occur.

7
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:59,333
Fuel that is not used for combustion cools the high-pressure fuel components and then returns to the fuel tank through low-pressure return lines.

8
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:10,875
Low-pressure fuel paths also exist to lubricate the internal parts of each high-pressure pump and to prevent excess fuel system pressure from damaging the high-pressure pumps.
