00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,667
In the second oil flow path, internal drilled passageways in the main frame carry the oil from the main oil header to the number 2 and number 8 cam bearing locations on both sides of the 16-cylinder engine.

2
00:00:13,667 --> 00:00:20,167
The oil entering the four camshaft bearings then travels lengthwise through the camshaft sections.

3
00:00:20,167 --> 00:00:26,042
Radial holes in the shaft sections supply oil to each of the other camshaft bearings.

4
00:00:26,042 --> 00:00:36,042
The camshaft bearings contain annular grooves connecting to passages in the engine main frame, from where the oil flows to the valve and fuel crosshead guides.

5
00:00:36,042 --> 00:00:44,792
The oil passage to the right number 7 and 8 (R7/8) camshaft bearings also supplies oil to the oil gauges and sensors.

6
00:00:44,792 --> 00:00:55,875
The oil then passes through the crosshead guides and into the crossheads, then up through the hollow push rods to oil the rocker and valve train assemblies to the tops of the cylinders.

7
00:00:55,875 --> 00:01:05,708
The oil gravity drains back down around the push rods and over the crosshead rollers and cam lobes before draining back into the crankcase.
