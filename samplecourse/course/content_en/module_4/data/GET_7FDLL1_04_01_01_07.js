				"text":"The purpose of the fuel oil system is to provide fuel to the cylinders for combustion and to provide cooling for the high-pressure fuel equipment. Fuel oil is supplied through parallel low-pressure fuel lines to the inlets of each high-pressure fuel pump. The pumps, driven by the camshafts, pressurize the fuel to over 18,000 psi. A solenoid, located on each high-pressure pump, is electronically controlled to open and close based on control signals from the Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI) computer. When the solenoid is open, pressurized fuel oil is fed to the fuel injector through the high-pressure fuel line. At a preset pressure, the fuel is sprayed into the combustion chamber where it combines with compressed air and ignites, causing combustion to occur. Fuel that is not used for combustion cools the high-pressure fuel components and then returns to the fuel tank through low-pressure return lines. Low-pressure fuel paths also exist to lubricate the internal parts of each high-pressure pump and to prevent excess fuel system pressure from damaging the high-pressure pumps."
