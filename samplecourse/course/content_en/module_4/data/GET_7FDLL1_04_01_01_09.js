				"text":"The purpose of the dual-pipe exhaust manifold is to channel the exhaust gases from the combustion chambers to the turbocharger to supply the energy needed to compress the combustion air. As the exhaust valves open, the exhaust gases exit into the exhaust manifold. The pressure created by the hot exhaust gases turns the turbine in the turbocharger. Then the exhaust gases exit to the atmosphere through the muffler assembly."
