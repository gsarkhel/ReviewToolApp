				"text":"The purpose of the combustion air system is to supply compressed air to the power assembly for combustion. At low speeds, the engine draws air through the turbocharger. At high speeds and increased loads, the energy produced by the hot exhaust gases drives the turbocharger's turbine, rotating the compressor. The heated air, up to as much as 350°F (177°C) at Notch 8, passes through the intercooler cores. These heat exchangers can cool the intake air to as low as 145°F (63°C). At idle or at light loads in cold weather, the air may actually be warmed by heat transferred from the water in the intercooler cores. From each intercooler, the air runs through an air manifold to the power assemblies. Within each power assembly, the air is supplied to the combustion chamber when the corresponding intake air valves are open."
