				"text":"In addition to the two oil flow paths to the internal engine components, lubricating oil is also supplied to the auxiliary drive gear end, barring-over gearbox, and the free-end components. The auxiliary drive gear is lubricated internally by oil flowing from a passage within the crankshaft through the gear hub. Oil passes through the bearings and returns by gravity to the crankcase. Lubricating oil is supplied to the barring-over gearbox by an internal drilled passageway in the main frame to the gearbox. The oil from the gearbox returns to the crankcase internally. The free-end bearing is lubricated through a passage from the engine oil header to an annular groove around the bearing. Another passage connects the annular bearing groove to a passage in the idler gear shaft to lubricate its bushing. The camshaft and split drive gears are splash lubricated through an orifice and pipe from the engine oil header. The bearings and drive gears of the lubricating oil and water pumps are lubricated by running partially submerged in oil in the free-end cover reservoir."
