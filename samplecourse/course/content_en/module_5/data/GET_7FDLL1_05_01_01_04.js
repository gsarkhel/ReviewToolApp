				"text":"The EFI system consists of four major subgroups. They are the EFI controller, the diesel engine speed sensors and top dead center probe, system sensors, and mechanical components. The EFI controller is the microprocessor that controls the EFI system. The EFI controller is a part of the Electronic Governing Unit or EGU. The primary function of the EGU is to control engine speed by controlling the high-pressure fuel pump solenoid located on each cylinder assembly. Through the control of the solenoids, the EGU can vary the fuel timing and the amount of fuel delivered to each cylinder. Along with controlling engine speed, the EGU performs some other important functions. Several inputs are sent to the EGU from sensors on the locomotive."
