				"text":"The EFI system monitors and identifies certain operating parameters and, if those parameters are detected as being outside normal limits, will alert the microcomputer system to reduce engine speed and/or alternator load and excitation. Sensors within the EFI system send the information related to the engine’s operating conditions to the Smart Displays. The difference between the EFI system and a mechanical fuel system is the ability of the EFI system to control fuel delivery timing. A solenoid, which receives electrical signals from the EFI computer, can tightly control fuel delivery timing."
