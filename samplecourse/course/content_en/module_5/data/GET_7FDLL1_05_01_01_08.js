				"text":"The engine position sensor, located on the left cam gear cover, is a magnetic pickup that sends pulses to the EGU. The EGU uses this information to determine the rotational position of the engine. The crankshaft speed sensors are magnetic pickups that detect engine speed by means of a tone ring located at the alternator end of the split gear on the crankshaft. The speed sensors are located at one of two possible locations on the 7FDL engine: either on a bracket inside the crankcase at the alternator end of the engine reading off a tone ring on the split gear, or outside the crankcase on the left alternator end of the engine reading off a timing ring assembled to the crankshaft. Note that only one of the two speed sensors is required to run the engine; the second sensor is a backup in case of a sensor failure."
