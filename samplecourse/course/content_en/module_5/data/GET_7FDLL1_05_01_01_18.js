				"text":"The high-pressure fuel pump is a solenoid controlled booster pump. The pump receives a steady supply of fuel from the locomotive’s low-pressure fuel system. The low-pressure fuel (90 psi) is boosted by the high-pressure pump to very high pressures (18,000 psi). The signals from the EGU control the closing point of the solenoid, thus providing the means to vary fuel timing. The EGU signals also control the duration for which the solenoid is opened, thus controlling the amount of fuel delivered."
