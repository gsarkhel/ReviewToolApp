00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
The purpose of the mechanical components is to deliver the correct amount of fuel to each cylinder for combustion.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:15,625
Each cylinder on the 7FDL diesel engine is equipped with a high-pressure fuel pump, a high-pressure fuel line, and an injector.

00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:23,708
The injector works as a check valve releasing fuel into the combustion chamber when the required pressure is reached.
