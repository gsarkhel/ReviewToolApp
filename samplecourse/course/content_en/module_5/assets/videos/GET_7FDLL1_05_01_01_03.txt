00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,500
The EFI system monitors and identifies certain operating parameters and, if those parameters are detected as being outside normal limits, will alert the microcomputer system to reduce engine speed and/or alternator load and excitation.

2
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:24,567
Sensors within the EFI system send the information related to the engine’s operating conditions to the Smart Displays.

3
00:00:24,567 --> 00:00:33,300
The difference between the EFI system and a mechanical fuel system is the ability of the EFI system to control fuel delivery timing.

4
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:40,500
A solenoid, which receives electrical signals from the EFI computer, can tightly control fuel delivery timing.
